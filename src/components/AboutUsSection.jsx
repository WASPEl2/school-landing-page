          Speak EZ was initially formed in 2002 as a weekend and holiday program
          for children at The Q Learning Center. The Speak EZ program became an
          instant success and was then adapted for use in schools. Using songs
          and games as teaching tools, Speak EZ’s fun and interactive approach
          to teaching English has led to the company’s rapid expansion. We now
          provide 4 different Speak EZ developed courses as well as providing
          “tailor made” programs for schools.

          “Having Speak EZ teach in our school has revolutionized our students
          understanding of English! Not only is their vocabulary improving, but
          they are developing a much clearer understanding of how English “fits
          together”
        </p>

        <p className="text-base sm:text-lg text-center mb-6 leading-relaxed">
          At Speak EZ we take pride in the reputation we have built over the
          years. We continue to work closely with our schools to ensure the
          courses and Teachers we provide suit each schools’ requirements. We
          make sure that while providing quality English education, we take time
          to listen too.
        </p>

        <p className="text-base sm:text-lg text-center mt-16 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
          Alongside teaching in schools, Speak EZ has become one of the leading
          providers of English camps for schools and businesses in and around
          Bangkok. With seven years of experience in the field we believe Speak
          EZ camps are both educational and fun providing Children with a unique
          opportunity to speak English on a daily basis.

          “The English camp Speak EZ organized for us was wonderful. The
          teachers were professional and the Children had a lot of fun! We will
          definitely have them back next year.”
