              SpeakEZ offers a wide variety of courses to schools in and around
              Bangkok. Our courses have been developed specifically for Thai
              students. Each school we work with receives a custom package of
              SpeakEZ-developed courses tailored to their needs and budget.

            <SectionParagraph>
              SpeakEZ courses cover all aspects of the English language. From
              speaking and listening to pronunciation and grammar, we ensure
              students receive the best possible education to improve their
              English skills quickly.
            </SectionParagraph>
            <SectionParagraph>
              We've developed a unique teaching method. Our intensive teacher
              training ensures classes are taught in a fun and exciting way.
              Each class is led by a native English speaker and supported by a
              Thai assistant, enabling students to participate more actively
              than in traditional textbook-based learning.

              Our teaching teams consist of a native English speaker and a Thai
              team teacher. We carefully select each teacher to ensure a high
              standard of education.

              We believe that SpeakEZâ€™s success is rooted in the quality of our
              educators. All teachers hold at least a bachelor's degree and have
              a minimum of one year of teaching experience. Ongoing training
              helps them stay inspired and equipped with fresh, fun ideas.

              Speak EZ uses songs and games to make English learning enjoyable.
              Native speakers work alongside Thai teachers to manage the
              classroom and assist with translations and activities. This dual
              approach allows students to participate more freely than in
              traditional settings.

              Students in a fun, engaging environment become naturally motivated
              to participate and learn from one another, enhancing the learning

            Young learners absorb information more effectively than older
            students. Early exposure to English sets the foundation for future
            success and removes the self-conscious barriers that hinder active
            participation.
